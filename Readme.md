Project Overview
Welcome to the "Chai Aur Backend" series, a comprehensive video series on building robust backend systems with JavaScript.

This project is a full-fledged backend application built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and other essential technologies. Our goal is to create a complete video hosting platform similar to YouTube, featuring functionalities like:

User authentication (login, signup)
Video uploads
Like, dislike, and comment system
Comment replies
Subscription and unsubscription mechanisms
Key Features
Authentication: Secure user sessions with JWT, access tokens, and refresh tokens.
Password Security: Implemented password hashing using bcrypt.
Comprehensive Functionality: Includes all features you'd expect in a video hosting platform, ensuring a real-world application experience.
We've invested significant time and effort into building this project, and we're confident that you'll gain valuable insights into backend development by following along. Whether you're looking to enhance your skills or seeking inspiration for your own projects, this series is packed with learning opportunities.
